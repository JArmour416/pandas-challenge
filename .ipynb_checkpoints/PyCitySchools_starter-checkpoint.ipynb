    "Overall, we learned that reading scores were always slightly higher than math scores. We learned that the 5 top performing schools were all charter schools.  The lower performing schools had a considerable amount more of students.  The grades did not increase or decrease throughout the grades.  The more surprising factor was that we did not see an improvement in scores based on the total budget or budget per student."
